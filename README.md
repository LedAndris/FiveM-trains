# FiveM-trains
Shitcoded, and barely working FiveM train system (for personal use, but I uploaded in case anyone wants to see bad examples to coding) [strings are written in Hungarian, maybe I will translate it some time]
# Problems: <br>
1. Random usage NetToVeh, VehToNet, NetworkGetEntityFromNetworkId, NetworkGetNetworkIdFromEntity usages (mixed up for worse readability ofc) <br>
2. Unoptimized (but it runs pretty smooth)
3. The train runs off the track sometimes (goes through buildings etc, then snaps back to the track) because of the high speed (configgable wow) <br>
4. Not really commented <br>
5. Shitty readability (I didn't plan to release this thats why) <br>
6. Rare commits (separate folder for the resource itself and for the github repo again, idk why [actually because uploading a shitton of github objects to the server would cause a lot of upload time) <br>
7. Not the best solutions to certain problems <br>
8. Shitton of useless prints (Thats my leftover debug codes)
# Advantages: <br>
1. Made by me
2. Made by me
3. Made by me
4. Pretty good sync, and has some pretty useful functions, that can be used separately, (`functions.lua`)
5. No dependencies
